**About me** - 
My name is Sebastian Stein. I work in [infosec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) with cloud technologies. On this blog I usually write about new ideas and things I learned while working with tech and reading stuff online. You can find out more [about.me](https://about.me/bersfo).

**About this website** - 
This is the base Jekyll theme. I customized it just a tiny bit - Here is the code: [https://github.com/bersfo/bersfo.com](https://github.com/bersfo/bersfo.com)
If you want to customize it even more, you can find Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

To make my life easier and to account for using many different devices, I use [siteleaf.com](https://siteleaf.com) to manage the blog. This way I only need to use github and a text editor to make changes to the site's layout. In addition this approach frees me from having to maintain and constantly patch a CMS.
